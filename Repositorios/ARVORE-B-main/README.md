# ARVORE-B
In this repository I present to you the implementation of a B Tree with integers as its keys.

The implementation was made in Java (but I wasn't that rigorous with dealing with exceptions hehe), so I used the properties of OOP like encapsulation and information hiding.
Feel free to use this code as much as you like. :):)
