I used the framework p5.js to create this first version of the game.

The framework already comes with a lot of graphics and mathematics functions prepared, so I just had to work on the games logic.

The bombs are represented by a -1, and when a cell is clicked it shows if it is a bomb, or how many bombs are in its surrounding. If you are suspecting that oone of the tiles is a bomb, you can click with the rigth button of the mouse in it and a B appears on the specified cell.
I wanted the cell to become red, but I coudn't figure out how to do it, cause if I use fill(255, 0, 0) the whole screen becomes red, if after that i use noFill() or fill(255) the game will be unable to play. (If somebody can help me out with that I appreciate)

Feel free to use, modify and give a comment on the project, I want this game to be preetier.
